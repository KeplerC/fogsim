CLOUDSIM CODEBASE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
====================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
FogSim is a co-simulation framework that enables integration between robotics simulation environments 
(Gym, CARLA) and network simulation to study the effects of network latency and bandwidth constraints 
on robotic systems. The framework combines two main components:

1. FogSim Co-Simulator Framework (./fogsim/)
2. NS.py Network Simulation Library (./ns.py/)
